VOC and Weather Sensor (BME680).

This module can be purchased on [Xinabox CC](https://xinabox.cc/products/SW02/).

## About the SW02
This ☒CHIP is a digital 4-in-1 sensor with gas, humidity, pressure and temperature measurement based on proven sensing principles.

The SW02 module is housed in an extremely compact 2U×2U chip. SW02 was designed to have the sensor isolated in the middle of the ☒CHIP to safeguard the sensor against any unwanted heat radiated from the other devices. 

More information on the BME680 can be found in the [datasheet](https://ae-bst.resource.bosch.com/media/_tech/media/datasheets/BST-BME680-DS001-00.pdf).
